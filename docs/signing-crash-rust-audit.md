# Personal signing Rust audit

Base: 6e8d82bd94cdd50cf1bbdb06674c6f62ef3aec6e.

The supplied device report establishes stack exhaustion on a 544 KiB Swift
cooperative caller during the synchronous signing FFI. The dedicated-worker
repair and regression evidence are detailed below. Actual on-device retesting
remains pending; this is not a claim of successful device signing.

## Earlier independent nested-runtime defect

Calling personal_sign::actual_udid from within an entered Tokio runtime
panicked at Tokio scheduler/multi_thread/mod.rs:91, with "Cannot start a
runtime from within a runtime". The regression runs this actual function in a
child process with a temporary invalid pairing file. Before the guard it failed
with exit 101, NOT SIGABRT. After the guard it returns an Arabic Result::Err
and the child succeeds. Swift's current detached signing worker is not itself
a Tokio runtime, so this fixture does not explain the reported Zeus crash.

The blocking API now checks Handle::try_current before constructing a runtime.
No authorization, profile matching, key/certificate checks, CMS warning policy,
or signing behavior on the supported Swift call path changes.

## FFI and archive evidence

al_ipa_editor_run and al_personal_p12_import already have catch_unwind inside
extern C. The workspace release profile and checked build scripts/workflows
contain no explicit panic=abort override. Default Rust unwind can be caught;
allocation failure, stack overflow, invalid foreign pointers, jetsam and signals
are not made recoverable by catch_unwind. No local reproduction of the original
device stack overflow was attempted; the supplied device report proves its
termination mechanism.

Added a direct FFI regression for null, malformed JSON, null JSON, missing fields,
and a nonexistent personal-sign input. All return owned error JSON and can be
freed correctly. Existing encrypted Mach-O/FAT validation, malformed input,
traversal, symlink, duplicate path, profile, UDID, identity-binding and P12 tests
remain passing. No decryption support was added.

ZIP extraction and packing already stream file contents; extraction enforces
512 MiB per entry, 4 GiB total and 100,000 entries. This does not imply signing
is low-memory. The signer still reads full Mach-O data; FAT signing processes
slices in parallel and retains signed slices. personal signing also reads full
executables for entitlement inspection and full Mach-O files for validation.
Those are possible memory-pressure risks, not proof of jetsam for this IPA.
No arbitrary new memory cap or broad signer rewrite was introduced without a
real failing artifact or on-device evidence.

## Validation

CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/mirsa-cert-rewrite/rust-core/target CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 \
 cargo test --manifest-path rust-core/Cargo.toml --lib

Current result: 57 passed, 0 failed. Linux host only; not an iOS device/ABI/runtime
test. Current full-suite log is /tmp/mirsa-stack-final.log on the web host.
The earlier nested-runtime regression failed before its guard and passes after;
its historical logs are /tmp/mirsa-nested-before.log and
/tmp/mirsa-sign-crash-after.log.
No production push, workflow dispatch, feed write or publication occurred.

The device termination report has now been obtained and reviewed in full.
Next validation is an iOS device retest of the original signing operation with
the dedicated-worker repair. Any signing material must be supplied securely,
never included in logs.

## Proven device termination and dedicated-worker repair

The subsequently supplied complete device report establishes stack exhaustion,
not jetsam or an allocation error. The triggered thread is a Swift cooperative
worker, with a 544 KiB stack and fault in its guard page. The trace is
PersonalCertificateSigner.sign -> al_ipa_editor_run -> ipa_editor::run ->
personal_sign::sign_with_options -> actual_udid -> Runtime::block_on ->
connect_tunnel -> PairingFile::from_bytes -> plist deserializer -> Reader::next.
The exception explicitly states Thread stack size exceeded, EXC_BAD_ACCESS,
SIGBUS. Reported app/build metadata is 1.3.2; it does not establish internal
release 83 or 84. No raw report, identifying values, keys or credentials are
committed here. It does not prove malicious recursion or malformed pairing.

The complete synchronous editor pipeline now runs on a dedicated named Rust
thread with 16 MiB stack. Only bounded input copying occurs on the FFI caller;
JSON parsing, archive operations, identity verification, actual UDID lookup,
root block_on future polling and signing execute on the dedicated worker.
Tokio worker stack configuration alone would not move that root future.
Spawn failure and join panic become Arabic JSON errors. Foreign pointers are
never sent to the worker; it receives an owned string. catch_unwind remains at
the FFI boundary. Stack overflow itself is still not catchable.

Pairing preflight uses the maintained plist stream parser, pinned at the locked
1.10.1 because its event API is explicitly unstable across minor releases.
It enforces 4 MiB input, depth 32, 65,536 events before recursive deserialization.
The common connect_tunnel entry validates all its callers, not just signing.
Disk pairing input also rejects nonregular/symlink paths and reads at most limit
plus one byte. No private record contents are logged. Existing device UDID,
profile membership, identity binding and CMS warning semantics are unchanged.

chub search plist returned no documentation. Used the installed pinned crate
source and https://docs.rs/crate/plist/1.10.1/source/src/stream/mod.rs instead.
The binary reader uses a heap stack and validates allocation spans against the
file trailer; the event preflight does not construct a recursive plist Value.

Production-path regression invokes the real exported FFI from a 544 KiB caller
inside an entered Tokio runtime, provides a matching fixture identity, and
reaches both real pairing parsers via signing/actual_udid/block_on/connect_tunnel.
Its structurally valid but incomplete synthetic pairing record fails closed
before networking. A separate worker regression touches a 1 MiB stack frame
and asserts worker identity/name. A test-only operation panics inside the real
FFI worker and verifies Arabic error JSON, never unwinding over extern C.
Additional tests cover XML and binary depth, byte and event limits plus shared
tunnel rejection. The generated guest regression also checks the NUL-terminated
Mirsa install name while preserving the original executable filename and plist
identity. Full Linux suite currently 57 passed. Actual iOS device
retest with the original signing operation remains pending; no claim of
successful on-device Zeus signing is made. Publication requires fresh owner OK.
